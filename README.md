# BetaKnuff - Experimental Ludo (Fia med knuff) Engine written in Python 3
This project implements a custom command-line based Ludo Engine (known as *Fia med knuff* in Swedish), allowing for simulation of a large number of games, development of artifical agents and other various Ludo testing. The end goal is to implement a machine learning based agent and investigate the nature of optimal Ludo play. It implements common rule variations such as entry with two players on roll 6 and more. Recommended to be run using pypy3 to improve simulation speed.
